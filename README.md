# DNS_tunneling
## Important Disclaimer
This project / home lab is intended strictly for educational security research and defensive detection development. It includes a controlled simulation of DNS tunneling techniques for the purpose of understanding how such activity appears on the network and how it can be detected by SOC analysts.

The DNS tunneling components are proof-of-concept implementations and are not designed for real-world misuse. They do not include persistence, exploitation, privilege escalation, or command-and-control frameworks beyond basic DNS query generation.

This project should only be executed in isolated lab environments or against domains you own or are authorized to test. Use of this project is subject to the terms of the included MIT License.
